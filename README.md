# React-Login-Registration-Form
 Creating login and registration page using MERN (Mongo, Express, React.js and Node.js) stack - Part 1 of the Coders Edge application project.

 I'm outlining the progression of building out an online application.

 This is part 1 of my Coders Edge project.  Coders Edge is a fictitious app that connects recently graduated computer science/bootcamp students with experienced, battle tested developers.  
 
 The experienced developers that sign up for the app can help new students with paid or free advise regarding their resume, technical interview questions, portfolio review, project freelance work,etc.

# Login/Registration Form

 Creating login and registration page using MERN (Mongo, Express, React.js and Node.js) stack - Part 1 of the Coders Edge application project.

 I'm outlining the progression of building out an online application.

 This is part 1/day 1 of my Coder's Edge project.  Coder's Edge is a fictitious app that connects recently graduated university, college and coding bootcamp students with experienced, battle tested developers.  The developers can charge per hour for their advice/feedback or they can offer free mentorship.

 This repo is going to feature just the sign up and sign in page.  Both registration and sign in will have JWT authorization. 

 My thoughts on the next steps : 

 - Now that a user can login, sign up and logout we need to determine if the user that just signed in is a student or mentor. 
 - I think it would make sense to have a mentor sign up and a user sign up.  Each with a different dashboard and profile page.
 - The mentor will be able to build out there public profile and respond to users inquiries
 - The user can search all the mentors available online or locally
